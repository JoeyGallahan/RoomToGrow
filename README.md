# RoomToGrow
I made this game in a week for the Blackthornprod Game Jam #3.

For my submission, I put a twist on the Game of Life by John Conway by making it into a gardening puzzle game.

In this game, there are 3 rules:

    Any flower with two or three neighbors survives.
    Any empty tile with three flowers near it becomes a flower.
    All other flowers die in the next turn.

-Levels-

    5 turns to plant/prune flowers on the map.
    3 actions (planting/pruning) per turn.
    Harder difficulties spawn weeds that take up space and don't give your flowers room to grow.
    Reach the target number of flowers and you win!

-Sandbox Mode-

    In the sandbox mode, be free! Make repeating patterns, spawn bigger maps, fill up all the tiles with flowers, do whatever you want. 

    Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom and hold it down to drag the camera around.
